The instructions are to be used to design your own similar model or to simply explore the tools used.
1. MicroBit - The microbit is available from Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/micro-bit/s?k=micro+bit; you can find group discounts that will lower the cost quite a bit.
2. SnapCircuits - several snap circuits kits exist and they are easy to connect to the MicroBit
3. Programming - The microbit is easy to get started with, lots of code is available at https://makecode.microbit.org
4. Teachable Machines by Google - you can use teachable machines with a laptop and camera.  Chromebook is great.  It is not necessary to connect it to the microbit like we did at the EoH.  https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/

Have Fun!!!
